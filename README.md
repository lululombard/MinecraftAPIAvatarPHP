# Minecraft Front Skin API
A simple PHP API with caching.

Without URL rewriting : `<domain>/?u=<username>` or `<domain>/?u=<username>&s=<size>`
With URL rewriting (htaccess) : `<domain>/<username>` or `<domain>/<username>/<size>`

Folder "cache_skins" will automaticaly be created and will store avatars to cache them for one hour.

API originaly made for [KingdomHills.fr](http://kingdomhills.fr/), no rights reserved, MIT licence.

I merged some code from other projects.
